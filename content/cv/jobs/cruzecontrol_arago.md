- As the South African Support Team Lead, I provided L2 support to large global companies for a clustered Java based general automation engine called HIRO.
- I focused specifically on the Linux implementation of HIRO and related Linux software which, for a cluster install, spanned many VM's running either Red Hat or CentOS using many "Big Data" softwares from Apache.
- Tasked with implementing many POC's to explore how we could alter HIRO's underlying software (Cassandra, ZooKeeper, Kafka, etc) and infrastructure (AWS) to perform better, carry out migrations, adding datacentres to the architecture, etc, all of which were fully documented.
- Liaised directly with clients to develop bespoke configurations for HIRO to tailor the product for their needs and ensure all expectations were met.
- Made extensive use of Bash and Python to automate processes pertaining to the monitoring and administration of HIRO.
- Created extensive documentation regarding every process, POC, installation, etc, ever undertaken to contribute to the internal Knowledgebase and to better train Support staff on how HIRO and related components operate with one another and their environment.
- Answer ZenDesk tickets, submit bug reports on JIRA and escalate issues about to breach SLA to developers and senior staff.
- Maintained multiple test environments spanning multiple HIRO versions, 20+ environments and various OS versions to ensure we have a good baseline environment to which all Customer environemnts must be benchmarked against.
