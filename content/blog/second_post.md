Hello!

As part of the [cloudresumechallenge.dev](cloudresumechallenge.dev) I started writing a static site generator in python using `markdown2` and `jinja2`, however, I am still getting to grips with it.

Below is a test of a code fence:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
printf "%s\n" "I am just testing embedded code!"
```

I will probably have to come back later to add more content here.
